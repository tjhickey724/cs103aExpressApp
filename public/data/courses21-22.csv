Capitalism awards income and wealth according to success in the marketplace. The welfare state provides income and services according to need. The legitimacy of capitalism and its gross inequalities is based on the premise that markets are efficient--but they often are inefficient as well as unjust. And the political power of capital often blocks policies that might allow the economy and society to become both more efficient and more just. Students often feel underprepared in their knowledge of formal economics, both orthodox and dissenting--and the connection of economics to the social policy topics we study at the Heller School.

When people make decisions, they draw on data, models (mental or formal), and goals that are shaped by their own experiences and the contexts&#39;political, organizational, and otherwise&#39;in which they are immersed. Decision making often suffers when situations include uncertainty, dynamically complex problems, high stakes, and time and performance pressures. We will look for connections between how people make decisions and the organizational outcomes we experience.

As students complete a series of writing assignments, they will engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing and revising, working in peer groups and individually with their instructors. Storytelling plays a crucial role in our lives. We draw on stories to make meaning of ourselves and others, to shed light on our experiences, and to express who we are or would like to be. The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies? How can storytelling bring about organizational change? Which traits do storytellers and business leaders share? What is the connection between storytelling and leadership?

The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies? How can storytelling bring about organizational change? Which traits do storytellers and business leaders share? What is the connection between storytelling and leadership?

But what exactly do we mean when we call something a distraction? How do distractions force us to attend to them, and why do we see this as a problem? In this course, we will explore how and why we draw the line between distraction and so-called “normal” or “healthy” attention. Borrowing analytical tools from the fields of medicine, psychology, philosophy, and cultural history and theory, we will examine both historical distractions (such as theater and film) and more contemporary ones (such as social media). We will also investigate the role played by distraction in such psychiatric disorders as ADHD and internet addiction. In analyzing these phenomena, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of how attention and distraction shape our experience of the world.

Here in Boston, we have a particularly close relationship with the cultural heritage of the founding of the United States; a stroll along the Freedom Trail will lead one past historically “sacred” sites such as the Old North Church and Bunker Hill, as well as to sites reminiscent of daily life such as the Boston Common and the Paul Revere House. However, communities in the United States and around the world often have a fraught relationship with cultural heritage because of the ways that it has been shaped by legacies of colonialism and oppression. These complexities are evident in longstanding debates around the repatriation of objects—such as the Elgin Marbles from Greece or the Benin Bronzes from what is now Nigeria—and in recent protests advocating for the removal of Confederate monuments. In this course, we will examine some of the conversations surrounding tangible cultural heritage. Who has the “right” to own objects? Who controls what stories are told about cultural heritage?

We typically assume that human attraction (and love) is much more nuanced and complex...but is it? Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures&#39;such as low body weight&#39;actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived?

Or read a story and imagined yourself as a character in its fictional world? Remember when you were a child experiencing many firsts, and asking why, or how? Works of fiction have a magic of revitalizing the reader’s curiosity and imagination. Science fiction, particularly, gets the readers excited about understanding how the world works and imagining their place in it. In this course, we use science fiction stories to build a fresh relationship with math and science and feel empowered to stay curious and ask questions. We attempt to answer some of the scientific questions by a powerful tool: mathematical modeling. As we embark on this journey, we learn how to become better friends with our computers by learning a little about their language. By the end of the course, MATLAB might become your favorite smart pocket calculator. The word ‘science fiction’ might give you mixed feelings: if you have ever tried to imagine yourself in a science fiction world but it felt like an exclusive club, prejudiced based on gender identity, sexual orientation, race, disability, and more, this course gives you the chance to reimagine a more inclusive science fiction world. Every two weeks, we read a science fiction story by a diverse group of writers, including Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Ken Liu, and Rebecca Roanhorse, who strive to make the science fiction community more inclusive. We also hear from a diverse group of speakers who discuss topics in race, gender, culture, and equity in scientific or science fiction communities. If the pandemic era has sparked your curiosity about the spread of diseases and you have found yourself watching documentaries on infectious diseases back-to-back, rejoice. In the first half of the course, we focus on topics in epidemiology and population growth, and ask questions like how long would it take for a vicious fungus to take over the world? Or if an alien parasite infected our planet, how could we model its spread as it takes over more human hosts? In the second half, we focus on bio-engineering models that inevitably lead us to questions surrounding climate change. Can we engineer our planet and control climate? As climate change has affected the frequency of natural disasters, can we predict earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes accurately? If all fails, is space going to be a second home for us? By the end of the course, we reevaluate our definition of science. What are our responsibilities towards, the consequences of, and limitations of using science to progress humanity? We will feel empowered and inspired to shape science into a more inclusive home for all. Special one-time offering, spring 2022.</span></p>"

These issues have raised important questions: To what extent do sports create a &#39;level playing field&#39; for women, transgender athletes and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC)? How do intersections of social class, mental health, and physical ability impact the discourse about race and gender in sports? In this class, we will investigate the history of racist and sexist policies and practices in amateur and professional sports as well as developments that place sports on the cutting edge of gender and racial equality in society at large. Case studies will include the raised fist salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, the passage of Title IX, current debates about financial compensation for elite NCAA athletes, and Colin Kaepernick&#39;s kneeling for the national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Course fee: $150.<br /><br />Encompasses the many facets that may present themselves to a researcher working in a laboratory setting. The primary goal of this course is to teach current methods in molecular biology in order to establish a foundational skill set that makes a student viable in today&#39;s research market. Along with this, enhancing the written format of acquired data, the art of presenting this data and scientific writing is also emphasized. Though the course meets during its scheduled time, the experimental designs contribute to real research projects from laboratories in the Biology department so that additional work will be required during off days and weekends depending on your time management. This time commitment simulates a research environment where students are responsible for their own experiments in order to prepare them for both a career in science and allow them to fully understand what attributes are necessary to be competent in the field of research. Students will be required to perform tasks when the class is not in session. Some of the techniques taught will include DNA isolation, DNA sequence analysis, generation of mutations, recombinant DNA cloning, RNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction including real-time quantitative PCR, yeast two hybrid systems, screening chemical libraries, Gateway &amp; Gibson cloning techniques, bacterial &amp; yeast strain constructions and DNA/RNA hybridization methods. There is a possible option of continuing the project as an independent researcher in the spring depending on the student and nature of the project.

This course explores the history of that relationship through various perspectives, geographies, terrains, and political traditions developing a conceptual understanding of our evolving relationship to the earth we inhabit. We will look at technology, agriculture, urban planning, forestry, and social movements as lenses through which to interpret that relationship. To do this, the course uses sources from history, film, literature, and political science to paint a broad picture of how humans have experienced the natural world and made sense of and/or resisted that experience. More importantly, students will come away from the class able to apply a critical and historically informed opinion of mainstream conceptions of the environment and our role within it.

Sex Sells! It&#39;s the immortal truism of the advertising industry. But how does sex sell? For decades, advertisers have used hot bods and innuendo to suggest that power and pleasure can be bought. In the 1970s, the battle cry, &#39;You&#39;ve come a long way, Baby!&#39; pushed cigarettes as the hip accessories of feminism and the sexual revolution. Today, brands blend consumerism with gender activism, invite LGBTQ to the mainstream marketplace, and tempt millennials with new promises of sex and success. In this course, students find and write about advertising that delights, infuriates, and perplexes them. In the first essay, they dissect their choice of pornographic food commercials, Budweiser bromances, and Calvin Klein billboards that titillate consumers and reshape social constructs of masculinity and femininity.

These will consist of: A) trying to enhance the binding efficiency and overall performance of a thermophilic polymerase, commonly used in PCR reactions, by adding a non-specific DNA binding domain.  B) continuing our screen of small chemical molecules on a model system that may inhibit the production of toxic proteins called Shiga toxins that can lead to Hemorrhagic Colitis in people.

But clinical relationships (as well as the relationships that medical researchers bear to their subjects) are ones of mutual accountability, and judgments about a patient’s autonomy are central to medical decision-making. Because of these features of medical practice and research, it is worth examining how a broader conception of responsibility might enhance our understanding of what we owe to each other in medicine. This course will begin by discussing some canonical and more recent philosophical approaches to our social practices of holding one another responsible, which would inform subsequent discussion of responsibility in medicine along the following lines: What would it mean to be responsible for your health, and how does discussion of responsibility for health relate to social determinants of health? Should judgments about responsibility for health play a role in health care rationing? Is there a meaningful relationship between being responsible and having decisional capacity as it is currently understood? If not, should there be? When should someone be held responsible for medical error, and what should that look like? Finally, what does it mean to be a responsible medical researcher, particularly in the context of community-engaged research? Usually offered every fourth year.</span></p><p><span>Larisa Svirsky</span></p>"

American literature, as a reflection of society, often depicts instances of political violence. Novels, poetry and short stories have a vexed and complicated relationship with history - are they just a representation of society as it is? Or can they be calls to action, provoking movements? In this course, we ask what political violence is and how it operates. Is that violence sometimes justified? If so, what conditions authorize it and what restrictions are there on its use? How much power does literature have to inspire or activate political action? What exactly is violence and what rhetorical and literary strategies are used to describe, validate or negate its use? “Violent Resistance” is envisioned as an introduction to these questions. In the course, we will investigate violent forms of American political protest through the lenses of some of the major theoretical approaches to violence, politics and literature available to us today. This is intentionally constituted as an interdisciplinary, cross listed course because we are fully convinced that interdisciplinary study not only offers a fuller, more rounded approach to the topic, but also because we are committed to the idea that each perspective broadens and deepens the other.

The history of energy is the history of modern political economy, technological shifts, climate change, and environmental catastrophe. The history of energy is also the history of global economic inequalities, colonialism, and fossil fuel wars. In this course we will consider how different energy regimes shaped our history and influence our future. As a major framework, we will use the moments of “energy transitions” that humanity experienced throughout its history: from non-fire to fire, and from fire and organic economy to fossil fuel (coal, oil, and natural gas). These energy transitions will lead us to the discussion on how to transit to the sustainable sources of energy to mitigate climate change. Does atomic power represent a realistic alternative? Are renewable energy and capitalism compatible? What are the benefits of switching to green energy and who is going to pay the costs? By bridging the space between energy history, economic history, and environmental history, this course will foster the development of incisive historical analysis and writing skills.
